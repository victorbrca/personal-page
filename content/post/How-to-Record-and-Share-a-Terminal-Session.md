A while ago I had shared instructions on "How to Share a Terminal Window Online". This is great for live support.

Today I'm sharing instructions on how to record your terminal session, and not only share it, but also allow users to copy and paste text from the playback video.

The installation could not be easier. And to show how great this utility is, I'm showing the instructions using a "video" recorded with "showterm".

Now go ahead and try copying text from the video. Isn't that great!?
