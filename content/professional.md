# History
<br />
Victor started using Linux in 2004 while working as a network support rep for 3Com. It quickly became a passion for him. His initial experience, like most Linux user enthusiast, was home based. He would spend hours and weekends building NAS, Apache, media servers, BSD firewalls and other "goodies". At some point his network was bigger than most small business (you can view it below).

Around 2007 he started a personal Linux blog at <a href="https://wazem.blogspot.com" target="_blank">wazem.blogspot.com</a>. The blog was a bigger success than he expected, with an average of 4000 visits per month.

In 2008 Victor decided to make a career out of his passion and enrolled for a Linux/Unix administration course at Seneca College. This was around the same time he created MUMU (Mississauga Ubuntu MeetUp, later MLUG, Mississauga Linux User Group).
