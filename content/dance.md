Victor started dancing in 2010 as part of a performance group for Brazil Dance World (a Toronto based brazilian dance school). During 2 years he did perfomances for various brazilian rhythms (like Samba de Gafieira, Forró, Zouk, Soltinho and Bolero), as well as event organization and classes monitoring. Early 2012 Victor parted ways with Brazil Dance World and stopped with all brazilian dancing.
